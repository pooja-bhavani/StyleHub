# Online Shop Architecture

## Architecture Overview
The online shop application follows a modern web architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Client-side rendering for product catalog and shopping cart

2. **Backend Layer**
   - RESTful API endpoints for product data, user authentication, and order processing
   - Database integration for product catalog, user accounts, and order history
   - Authentication and authorization services

3. **Database Layer**
   - Product catalog database
   - User account database
   - Order history and transaction database

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker containerization (poojabhavani08/online_shop:latest)
   - Load balancing for high availability
   - CDN for static assets

## Data Flow
1. User accesses the online shop website
2. Frontend requests product data from the backend API
3. Backend retrieves data from the database
4. User adds items to cart (stored in browser localStorage)
5. User proceeds to checkout
6. Backend processes payment and creates order
7. Order confirmation is sent to user

## Security Features
- HTTPS for all communications
- JWT for authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)

## Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of backend services
- Database sharding for large product catalogs
- Caching layer for frequently accessed products
